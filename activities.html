                <p>Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and visit the volcano. 
                    However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered 
                    fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, 
                    dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art 
                    galleries, and bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. Many of these
